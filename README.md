# Wikipedia_Data_Mining
What can we find from Wikipedia Featured Articles?

In this small task, I am supposed to use HTTP requests to receive JSON objects, and clean real
HTML data from the open web. In particular, we will be scraping content from Wikipedia. The
English-language Wikipedia has over 5 million articles, and about 0.1% of those have been reviewed
by the community as Featured Articles . 

The full list of all featured articles is at the following URL:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_articles

Wikipedia makes all public edits in the history of the wiki available through a public API, documented
at https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page .
